Munchkin,Work and Employment,Pawn Shops,"I worked at one for over three and a half years. This doesn't sound like much in the grand scheme of things, but I survived a take-over, three managers, and being held at gun-point, as well as two snatch-and-grabs and one smash-and-grab (a whole bag of experiences in and of themselves x.x). I was expected not just to be a sales person, but dealt in loans, buys, and of course haggling.",no
Munchkin,Luxury Items,Jewelry; Selling,"The most important income for the pawn shop. Testing gold, sizing diamonds, weeding out the real from the cz and gold plated/gold filled junk, we were expected to handle it all. We weren't expected to pay based off of colored stones though or silver, nor in grading diamonds (though we could at least tell if it was frozen snot or actually worth something). To this day I find myself dishing out advice to friends and family about prices and where to find the best deals.",no
Munchkin,Crime,Robbery,"As mentioned above, I have experience in being held at gun point, being a direct victim of two very different snatch-and-grabs, and being a less direct victim of a smash-and-grab. I had to turn inward to really disect the experiences at one point and am willing to be an open book about them.",no
Munchkin,War and Fighting,Martial Arts; Taekwondo,"I earned my black belt back in '98. It's been years since I've taken a class, but I still remember quite a bit of the history, technique, forms, step fighting... I also participated in the 7th and 8th annual Jimmy Kim Tournaments, as well as an open invitational my school held. I don't know if I'd be of any use for writing fight scenes, but I can at least give an idea of how the school was run, the form side of participating in tournaments, and help with technique.",no
Munchkin,Living Situations,Homelessness,"I lived on the streets for a total of four months. It was toward the end of summer, with about a month-long spell in winter in NorCal. There's a lot that can be said here, but I think I'll keep it relatively short for now. I will say though that I came from a high-middle-class family that wound up having to file for bankruptcy, to a low-middle-class family that actually knew how to budget for things, to cutting all ties and building my own life from the ground-up. I literally lived under a bridge during that time. I know what it means to go from everything to nothing to something.",no
Munchkin,Religion,Christianity; Latter Day Saints,"I'm technically an inactive member. My experiences are from a church in NorCal, where trailor trash yuppies ran rampant >.> I do have some great experiences and some not-so-great though. Didn't quite make it to the real 'meat and potatoes' of it all, but I did last a little over a year after baptism. I also know some very pointed differences between the main branch and the 'reformed' branch.",no
Munchkin,Writing,Poetry,"I used to write it all the time. I wouldn't really call myself an expert what with how long it's been with only the ocassional dabble, but I still enjoy reading and commenting and aiding in the making. I was also the Editor-in-chief for Civilized Beasts: 2016 Edition (link in my signature! [/shameless plug]) and will be for the 2017 Edition.",no
Munchkin,Education,Private School; Gifted and Talented,"I attended Pilgrim Lutherin Church and School in Chula Vista way back when I was a wee kitten. I don't have much in the way of memories since I left it at the age of 8, but I remember clearly what the transition was like x.x Trust me, it sucked. The only thing I had to look forward to was two years of Gifted And Talented Education, which was advanced classes held once a week after school. Yep, I learned the Scientific Method in the 3rd or 4th grade.",no
Munchkin,Sex and Sexuality,Misc; Polyamory; Multiple Partners,"""I have had some. With other people. I thought this worth mentioning as some writers of furry erotica clearly havenâ€™t."" I've also been part of threesome relationships before. I could probably write a whole novella on those experiences in and of themselves, but would rather not x.x",no
Munchkin,Kink and Fetish,Master/slave or Owner/pet,"I probably haven't spent near as much time in one as quite a number of others, but I've paid my dues. I've both been collared and collared people, and have a decent understanding for the multitude of variety under the big huge umbrella of BDSM beyond some of the cliches. Though I no longer run in those packs, there's still a collar on the nightstand that's tagged me as owned by Amenthor xp I also called upon this experience a bit in my story ""Home At Last"" found in Will of the Alpha: Volume 3",no
Munchkin,Mental Health,Bipolar Disorder; Suicidality,"To a lesser degree on the former with lower manic cycles, but definitely there depressive cycles (in this case, the definition of depression being lethargy, the difficulty in caring about things that used to excite, inspire, or enthuse, or anything at all really. Existing just for the sake of existing, etc). For the latter, both on the ""knife's edge against the wrist"" side (literally) and the ""lost loved ones to suicide"" side (literally).",no
Munchkin,Mental Health,Multiple Personality Disorder; Schizophrenia; Other than self,"Not living with as in having it, but I lived a few years with someone who had it. It was a very... interesting, and at a couple of rare times terrifying experience. I had borrowed from this experience a bit for my story ""Tech Flesh"", found in Furtual Horizons.",no
Munchkin,Mental Health,Panic Attacks; Other Than Self,"My ma had them due to a growth that was triggering her adrenal gland. Even when she had the growth removed, she still had some psychologic issues that would give her panic attacks. Lived with her like this for about a year and a half, maybe two years, and it led to my ma's gambling addiction.",no
Munchkin,Addiction,Gambling,"I got to watch the slow build-up over time, and how it can utterly destroy a family. It was due to her addiction that my dad had to file for bankruptcy, I spiraled into depression and suicidal thoughts, and led to their divorce. I have quite a few stories to tell about that time in my life.",no
Munchkin,Love,Obsession,"I was actually obsessed with this idea for a good chunk of my teenage years and did quite a bit of research. The very first ""therapeutic"" stories I wrote, when I first gave myself permission to go wild and cut loose, dealt directly in this field. Love talking about it.",no
Munchkin,Religion,Agnosticism,"What it means to be the equivalent of a spiritual wanderer, always searching for those tidbits of Truth without being tied down to a singular 'truth'. It can be disheartening, freeing, discouraging, joyous, terrifying, intriguing, amusing, depressing, and all-in-all incredible.",no
Munchkin,Writing,Mary Sue/Gary Stu,"This is a major pet peeve of mine, so I tend to recognize the traits pretty quickly. I'm also pretty good at sniffing out the anti-Mary Sue, which can be just as annoying. I do recognize where they have their places in the world, but also where they don't. Feel free to poke at me if you have any concern of your protagonist turning into this.",no
Munchkin,Mythology,Egyption; Greek; Norse; Japanese,"Not as learned as some, but definitely a high interest of mine. Unfortunately, such passions can make stories based on such leave a bad taste in my mouth. I can definitely help get to the bare bones of these mythos (especially the first two), but be warned that I'm very picky with 'personal interpretation'. Chances are if you have a question pertaining to any of these mythos and I don't already have the answer, I'll know where to find it. For the record, favorite gods from each zone are Sekhmet of Egypt (with Thoth as a close second), Athena from Greece (with either Apollo or Hermes as a close second), Siff from Norse (yes, even more than Loki  though he's a close second), and Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto from Japan (with Susanoo-no-Mikoto as a close second.).",no
Munchkin,Mental Health,Depression,"I was clinically diagnosed when I was 15 years old. After I was put on Paxil, had the dosage up, changed to Prozac, and had the dosage upped again, I felt like an absolute zombie. I took the time to research depression on my own, including all the symptoms and the best ways to counter them. I then pulled a real stupid and weened myself off of the medication (DO NOT DO THIS!!! CONSULT A DOCTOR FIRST!!!). Thankfully I weened off slow enough to have minimal effects, and I've been off of medication ever since. Every person is different though. For some, keeping an eye open for the signs and forcing yourself to reverse them simply isn't enough. For some, the medication really does help. I'm just not one of those some. But yeah, I know quite a bit of what clinical depression is and how I've countered it, and what happens when I can't bring myself to care enough to counter it >.< Happy to answer any questions.",no

Voice,Religion,Exorcism,"I have an obsession of sorts with real life examples of exorcisms and those that perform them, be they actual Bishop sanctioned priests or Deliverance ministers.

Koakai,History,Archaeology,"I hold my bachelors in the field, and have been on a couple of digs. One of these years I will go back for my Masters since I adore the subject, there is just no money in it. My experiances are limited to the Americas though, so if you want an Egyptologist you are in the wrong spot. I did a lot of zooarchaeology (animal remains. golly gee, wonder why).",no

Koakai,Hobbies,Fishing,"Spent a part of every summer on the coast with my grandparents saltwater fishing. Recreational, so don't expect great tales of the gillnetters or other commercial boats.

threetails,Religion,Reincarnation,"The reason I became interested in the above. A very harrowing personal experience brought to my attention that this was indeed a distinct if profoundly disturbing possibility.

Sean Rivercritic,Editing,Misc.; Copyediting; General Editing,"Pretty natural that I'd have at least some knowledge on this.

Note that not ALL of this info is free! (Though most of it is.)",no
Sean Rivercritic,Living Situations,Poverty,"Being poor sucks, and I've dealt with it my entire life.

Sean Rivercritic,Sport,Bowling,"Now this is something I have a damn-near endless knowledge base on. I've been bowling in sanctioned leagues since I was three years old and had been invited to go professional upon winning a big northeastern youth tourney back in my teen years. Couldn't do it due to injury, but I learned the sport inside and out because of it. Averaged 220s back in my teen years, and 230s for awhile just after turning 18. Injuries are getting to me now, but I can still hang with some talented bowlers.",no
blizleopard,Weaponry,Misc. Firearms; Assault Rifles; Pistols; Rifles; Grenades; Grenade Launchers; Firing Ranges,"Due to a particular interest/obsession, I have studied the development of most modern firearms, including the basic workings of said weaponry, up to and through most modern assault rifles. I have fired most major brands of pistols, and a few rifles, so I understand the actual feeling of a weapon going off in my hand or against me, and have had basic rifle training in both military and civilian settings. I have also had the dubious pleasure of using a live-fire M60, and an M203 grenade launcher. Most of this was done during US Army basic training in the mid-90s, and personal research based on fact-checks on movies afterwards. There is an indoor firing range I go to at least 2-3 times a year where I can fire new weapons I see, and talk with the guys at the counter, all of whom help train local police.",no
blizleopard,War and Fighting,Martial Arts; Taekwondo,"I formerly held a Black Belt in South Korean Military Tae Kwon Do, which I trained in from the age of 14 to 17. While my knowledge is rusty, like with others, it has given me a better working knowledge of the human body and fight mechanics.",no

blizleopard,History,World War II,"My grandfathers both were active in World War 2, my paternal grandfather a reservist naval engineer who helped design a safety-lock bar still used today on most aircraft carriers, and my maternal grandfather a radio operator for the US Army Air Corp. My father made several studies of World War 2's pacific theater, and imparted a lot of that on me, and the interest still remains.

blizleopard,Fictional Lore,Star Wars,"I know this is entirely a fan-based thing, but I watched the movies to death, all the TV series that were ever made, and read every novel written before the Yuuzhan Vong saga that in my opinion ruined the Expanded Universe Books.  I own most of the West End Games Star Wars RPG books and supplements, and have some of the d20 remake books in house, as well as the 4.0 books that were made before the line was dropped. While Star Wars is it's own thing, what it can be used for is a basis to mine knowledge for building your own science fiction universe, including examples of how tech works in one sense so you can derive your own ideas from it, and also the designed structures for militaries, governments, and cultures of the times in the books.",no

In terms of herbalism and ethnobotany I'm somewhat mixed, with lots of experience on plants in the intermountain West and Western Europe, but I'm still learning coastal Pacific plants.

Kitswulf,Religion,Occult,"Like some of the others posting here I'm a huge fan of all the old symbolism and culture surrounding magic and the supernatural.

Kitswulf,History,Ancient Warfare,"Light hobbyist, so I lack the intensive dedication of some folks in the field, but I really enjoy pre-gunpowder warfare both in a historical and fantasy/fiction context.

Anyway, the swamp was my home and its sounds, systems, scents, denizens, moods and motion I can always help with. (Though every swamp is vastly different from every other swamp!

I was able to do one flight between when I finished my license and when I left Florida. What does a seventeen-year-old swamprat swordfighting seventh-grade-dropout musician from the Florida swamp do to earn money? Why move to the Bay Area of California and get a job as a unix systems administrator in the tech industry, of course. That progressed over the course of my career to unix systems architect to the nebulous 'cloud systems architect' title I finished my career with almost twenty years later.  My strongest area of expertise, sadly, and the career that has made me more money than I'll ever come close to seeing again.

I know this."", then please give me a poke before you decide to write a scene about your clever hacker wtfpwning a system.

(Which is why I could tell the history teacher she was absolutely wrong, which is why (among other reasons) I left school in the 7th grade... oh well!) At any rate, that progressed to reading about aviation, US fleet sub operations, U-boats and tech, and ... well, a whole lot more about aviation.

I figure how much I'm allowed to spend. And then I spend it. Store managers know only that they've called a repair line. I deal with corporate types, min wage workers, and tradesmen... if you need insight into retail and corporate procedures and repairs, I can help. I can explain purchase orders, work orders, job numbers, mutual clients, 3rd party and 4th party web-sites... and 45 day turn around for payments.",no
Greyflank,Work and Employment,Plumbing; Sewerage,"If you want to know how to make human waste run uphill, I can help you with that. I can also tell you some basic plumbing stuff, from drains to grease-traps, and maybe get you some video of clogged sewer lines. But, pumping human waste uphill is, sadly, one of my specialties. I am also a SME for Backflow Protection Devices, which is all about clean water, so that's not as sexy--",no
Greyflank,Safety,Fire Safety,"Sorry, the science of pyrotechnics is beyond me. But if want to know if a cigarette lighter will really set off the sprinklers (NO), then I can help you with that. I can also explain why Chicago, California, and New York have different kinds of exit signs and why you have to call the Department of Transportation in Times Square to replace a valve, while the same job in Staten Island (the same city officially, but a different county) doesn't need a permit when replacing like for like.",no

Greyflank,Kink and Fetish,BDSM; Ponyplay; Bondage; Rules,"and generally fetishes of all flavours. I'm a ponyboy wannabe (who can afford all that gear?) and a member of Bondage.com going on twenty years now. I'm a switch, which means that I have my sub moments and my dom moments. I'm big on rules so I tend to include a lot of fetishes under BDSM; especially the socialized sex because they have rules. Clown Sex has rules, for example, so I consider that BDSM. I would not be able to defend that stance in a serious intellectual setting; I just mean to say, ask me anything and I'll try to answer it without much titillation.",no
Greyflank,Work and Employment,Comics,"I've worked in comics and created a few, went to cons, etc. I can explain why an inker isn't a tracer, what the blue lines are for, what's with Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, shed light on obscure Funny Animals, and a few other things I'll enjoyed researching.",no

Mog Moogle,Work and Employment,Police,"I was in Law Enforcement for six years with a specialization in narcotics. From NIKs to jargon, if it's drugs and Law Enforcement, I probably know it. Also to a lesser extent I did a lot of traffic crash investigation. Was involved in one use of force where the subject, (thankfully,) made the right decision at the last moment to save his life. So all the headaches and paperwork of that, I'm familiar with. Very familiar with the court process, and have a 100% conviction rate on every case that went to Grand Jury or trial.",no

Mog Moogle,Drugs,Tobacco,"Tobacco and tobaccina. If you've ever wondered why a cigar described as, ""leather and black pepper with earthy notes"" would be appealing to anyone, I can tell you. I have a collection of over twenty pipes, both briar and meerschaum. I smoke mostly aromatic pipe tobacco, but delve into English every now and then.",no
Mog Moogle,Society,Politics,"I usually make it a point not to talk about religion and politics, but I would do if you need the PoV of someone who grew up Pentecostal and discovered he was attracted to men. Though I tend to lean more Libertarian, (small government, big individual responsibility,) I am Conservative in political views. Since that's seemingly a rarity among the LGBTG crowd, I'd be happy to explain why I have those beliefs under the condition that it stays as civil as possible, and I'll do my best to do the same. ^.^",no

FallenKitten,Work and Employment,Academia; Laboratories,I've worked over ten years in University labs. I know how good labs operate and how bad labs operate. I generally grok the tenure system (In the US) and how the grad student the post docs generally get screwed (I am glad to be neither anymore). Most of that time I've been involved with small animal research and I'm a fairly good mouse surgeon. Good bad or Ugly if its Academic research I've seen most of it.,no

I also have a MA in Gender Studies from an institution focused on the study of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East with a dissertation on boys-love manga. I have presented papers on queer theory and yaoi, queer theory and political science in No. 6 (publication in the works), and gender performativity and drag. (For an example of the impact on my studies on my writing read my story ""Moral Folly"" in FANG 6) I have read a lot of post-structualist, materialist, and post colonial theory, a smattering of psychoanalysis, conflict theory, and legal theory. Additionally, I have studied pop music and culture, East Asian music and culture, I performed taiko in university and participated in a Balinese dedication ceremony for my school's gamelan. I have extensive experience in studying globalization and transnational human rights politics (primarily feminism and gay rights). Additionally, I have a background in the history of sexuality, both Foucault, western developments, and eastern developments (and why gay rights ""lags"" behind in eastern cultures). ",no
Camio,Education,University; Study Abroad,"I attended a small private four-year undergraduate college in America. I served on committees and as elected positions in some clubs, including as treasurer for the second or third most funded (and most corrupt) club. One committee I served on was an independent advisory committee to the president on sexual assault and harassment on campus. I also did a lot of work in multicultural affairs. I spent four months studying at a university in Japan, halfway between Kyoto and Osaka. I spent 10 months at graduate school in London at one of the most leftist leaning schools (we had school holidays for protest marches). Coursemates came from all over the world including several prominent countries in current events and I studied with some of the premier scholars of the Middle East as well as activists.",no

I actively research popular music, mostly on the independent neo-cabaret movements and gender in popular music.",no
Ukeru,Religion,Shamanism; Christianity; Spiritual Materialism,"I lived in a town with seven different sects of Christianity competing for members and against one another, and I grew up a Baptist. It was my first experience in community and one of the most strange as a child. I truly believed in the 'Word' and was baptized at 12. It would lead me to a crisis of faith later when I realized that no one in the community actually lived by the Bible's teachings and only used them as a shield against their own transgressions. This led to an identity crisis as well, where I fell into a deep depression and further more couldn't understand who I was anymore. I became a spiritual materialist, gathering bits and pieces from many different spiritual teachings and dogmas. I know a little bit about a lot of religions and spiritual practices ranging from Christianity's many sects to Neo-Paganism. I'm not an academic here, but know a lot of rituals, concepts, and faiths. This led me to even deeper depression as nothing I learned reflected that which I was seeking. I found Shamanism and realized just how silly I had become searching for the answers I needed outside of me. Through Shamanism I found that religion wasn't necessarily sacred and that the sacred things I were looking for was, to use a cliche, inside of me. I still struggle with this, and I'm not a practicing shaman (I'd need to go on my 'journey' for that), but I know a lot and could likely answer questions for those curious.",no
Ukeru,Abuse,Emotional Abuse; Physical Abuse; Psychological Abuse; ,"I've seen my father and mother hit each other. I've seen my brother and I be struck and hurt for no reason outside of cruelty by those that were supposed to protect us. I've abused others as well. Most of my childhood was punctuated by emotional, physical, or psychological abuse from family and extended family. I've also been in work situations where abuse of trust and emotions were rampant and expected of staff. It's made it difficult to trust others, and while I am capable of that now, I find myself still questioning intentions even to this day. It's strange to think I have so much knowledge on this, but a lot of my thoughts are centered on abuse and somehow moving past it.",no
Ukeru,Mental Health,Psychosis; Other Than Self,"I also grew up with a family member who was committed for insanity several times in their life. This person tried to murder me in my sleep because 'God' told her to. It was a terrifying experience, but allowed me to glimpse what someone who isn't completely connected to reality could do and choose. I can give some insight into insanity and how it affects others.",no
Ukeru,Society,Racism,"In line with abuse, I've lived in rural Texas for a majority of my life. I was one of the few minority students in a 99.9% white school and have been called every racist name and pejorative imaginable, including those that didn't make sense. I've had people light my things on fire, to put me in my place. Guns pointed at me for looking different. I've had KKK members threaten my family because of the way I looked, and people at school laugh about it (including teachers and the principal). I've been ostracized by those which only a few years prior were playing with me on the playground.",no
Ukeru,Living Situations,Texas,"I know what a small community with more cows than people runs like, where there is no grocery store unless you want to take a 25 minute drive and the movie theater and mall a half hour away were the only things to see and talk about as a younger person. A car/truck were mandatory. Texas isn't all bad, but I did experience a lot of that which people fear and dislike in it. The pine belt where I lived was beautiful and wild, and sometimes, I do miss that smell. I think it's why I like Seattle so much, honestly.",no
Ukeru,Work and Employment,Farming,"I know how it is to raise industrial chickens. It's disgusting, filthy, and unrewarding work to put chicken into grocery stores. I've walked through tens of thousands of chickens, cramped together, eating whenever they heard the feeders going because they were bred that way. I saw them balloon in size and shape in weeks. I've seen the antibiotics and terrible conditions that are required for that kind of output, as well as the lack of compassion required to raise them this way. If you want to know the deal on chicken farms, I'm your guy.",no
Ukeru,Social Movements,Environmentalism,"I worked at the EPA for nearly 9 years and have picked up a lot of knowledge on the state of the environment in the United States. From Superfund sites to how a cleanup of a place works, if you want to know horrifying things that'll make your toes curl and the atrocities many companies commit without knowledge of many and accountability at all, I'm your guy. If you want to know the things people are doing to save the planet, I can help with that as well.",no
Ukeru,Social Sciences,Government,"Sort of keeping with working in the EPA, I've seen how the government machine works from the inside. I've been a cog inside of it. It's slow, clunky, mostly underfunded (except the military and even then isn't appropriated well at times), and doesn't accept change well (unless you're in NASA or the health organizations, and even then it's hamstrung). If you want to know bureaucracy and how that works, I can help out. It's not all bad news though; I've met some of the most passionate and intelligent people working for the government. If you have a question about government workers and my perspective, I can definitely help there.",no
Ukeru,Social Sciences,Conspiracy Theories,"As part of my government stint, I've read and heard nearly every government conspiracy theory out there. I also know quite a bit about those things that sound like conspiracies but actually aren't (MKUltra, MK OFTEN). I know a bit about UFOs and talked often with a few coworkers who believed that the US actually had created the things we call UFOs. So, I have some strange knowledge about these. I might be able to tell you whether something is based in reality or if it's mostly fancy. That said, my experiences have shaken what I think I know to the core and opened my imagination to the possibilities that what we know might not be sufficient to be 'true'.",no
Ukeru,Visual Art,Yaoi; Manga,"A secret passion of mine for many years. I was fascinated with these kinds of comics and took them in as a way to understand part of myself (the part that likes guys). While I'm no longer buying them with any frequency, I know a lot of the tropes of yaoi and can assist if you're looking for insight into that (or just what the heck an uke or seme really are).",no
Ukeru,Sex and Sexuality,Misc.; Repression,"More personal, but I know a lot about repression and how it stunts sexual growth and also shapes it.",no
Ukeru,Kink and Fetish,BDSM; Submission,"I prefer submission and can tell many stories of my wandering into bondage, BDSM, and how sex may be different for someone who doesn't receive pleasure from being the ""top"" in a sexual relationship. While I don't consider myself an expert, I do have a lot of knowledge on submission and how that plays into sex and how my repression at a young age actually led me to this.",no
Ukeru,Hobbies,Video Games; Card Games; Board games; Tabletop Games,"I've been gaming a long time! Since my dad bought a NES when I was 8, and I defeated Super Mario Brothers for the first time, I have had a special place in my heart for games. Board games, card games, table top, and video, all are important to me. I have a wide knowledge of many different kinds of games and genres. If you want suggestions or insight into gaming, I may have that knowledge. I'm also an experienced Game Master for several rule sets, so if you'd like to know what it takes to run games for others and how to generate worlds that are consistent and fun to play in, I can help with that!",no
Ukeru,Sex and Sexuality,Bisexuality; Pansexuality,"Having repressed urges over half of my existence, it's only recently that I've been able to live more openly and love who I will. This sort of ties into repression and sex, but may be of use to those who want to know what it's like to not necessarily be attracted only to one biological sex.",no
Ukeru,Death,Misc.; Experience; Near Death Experience,"From picking up the dead on our chicken farm to having witnessed someone kill themselves at a young age, death has always been a part of my existence from a young age. I have nearly been struck by lightning, hit by a car, nearly drowned at the age of 6, nearly didn't save my mother from drowning, almost cut in half by a run away industrial chicken fan, witnessed a friend go into anaphylactic shock and nearly die, had a car go haywire and crash nearly killing me and my brother, nearly stampeded by cattle three times, almost mauled by wild boars, and almost kicked in the head by a horse. I've seen death nearly claim me and others often, and I've seen others die in front of me. I've killed creatures as well, hunting, fishing, and because I was told to. I know death and death knows me.",no
Ukeru,Nature,Wildfires,"I've been in the middle of a few wildfires, I've seen swaths of land burn and crumble under what seems to be a nearly supernatural force when you're watching it. The news likes to focus on the large flames and the inferno, but the scary part to me is the smaller flames that go on as far as the horizon. Watching as if the land itself were a dry piece of paper, incapable of resisting the line of burn steadily flowing across it.",no
Ukeru,Nature,Floods,"Fire ant balls larger than basketballs, whole forests rushing down what used to be roads, hoping your livelihood won't wash away, and more. I've seen three major floods in my life, and they were each awe inspiring.",no
Ukeru,History,2003 Space Shuttle Columbia Disaster,"Nacogdoches, Texas was on the national news for a while when the Columbia exploded over the earth. Pieces of it fell all over my town, my home, our lands. We saw some gruesome things I won't talk about here unless asked and the worst and best in people those weeks. We found pieces of the shuttle on our land larger than our truck and smaller than our fingernails. I touched tiles and saw circuits and pipes for miles. If you want to know what happened in the debris path, I can answer quite a few questions on that since I lived it.",no
Ukeru,Group Membership,Boy Scouts,"I was a scout for a long time. It was one of the better experiences of my life. I was a Senior Patrol Leader, sold way too much of that popcorn, and eventually became unable to finish Scouts and become and Eagle Scout because of personal value conflicts and people trying to help me 'cheat' my way in quickly without work. I ended up leaving before I completed the project I needed and spiraled into my identity crisis which would last quite some time. However, I know a lot about camping, rope tying, making fires, building simple structures, and self-sufficiency for short periods of time outdoors.",no
Ukeru,Animals,Livestock,"I grew up around cattle and chickens. I came to understand cows and chickens very well and even was able to train some of our chickens before they went off to slaughter. I seem to have some affinity for animals in general, but cats in particular seem to like me more than my peers and friends. Most cats, even when they are skittish, will warm up to me very quickly and I have a strong intuition when they interact with me on what they are trying to communicate. This has manifested recently in my cat who seems to treat me as an ally and best friend who is really bad at being a cat but he loves me anyway. People are constantly surprised at how he interacts with me. So, while I hadn't thought of it as a knowledge before, I think it's something to note. I have some sort of animal affinity, even if I don't often interact with them in the city.",no
Ukeru,Mental Health,Suicide,"I have battled with suicidal thoughts for over a decade now. I have witnessed others take their lives as well. Since I've found a method of analyzing myself that isn't judgmental, it's become easier to not listen to the many voices requesting one resigns from life, but I'm still prone to the voices which haven't gone away. If you want to know what it's like to have these thoughts, I might be able to provide some insight.",no
Ricky_P,Family Structure,Fatherlessness,"Sad story time: I didn't grow up with a dad; he died from leukemia when I was only 3 1/2. So, of course, I never got to know him personally, only through my mom and other relatives. From what I gather, though, he was a great guy who loved his family.  Most of my life, it's just been me and my mom, and my mom had to play both parental roles of the household caretaker (typically mother) and financial provider (typically father). We moved quite a bit too, because my mom kept getting laid off or fired for no reason, plus she's always had a hard time finding a job despite that she's had a Bachelor's in Accounting for the longest time; only a few years ago did she get her Master's in that field.  There was one point where my mom remarried, but it didn't turn out the way we both wanted. The guy my mom married seemed like a good guy, and he was probably the reason why I'm more of a geek now than when I was younger, haha. However, she felt like she was taking care of another child, and I saw him more as someone to hang out with rather than a father. She was married to him for three years until they divorced, and that damaged us financially.  It wasn't until college when the fact I didn't have a father all my life really hit me. Now, it bothers me quite often and makes me jealous of my friends who've always had a father they get along with. Me, my mom, my extended family, and anyone else who knew him well will forever ask, ""Why?"" And that's yet another question that will never be answered.  Despite my fatherlessness though, I do see a few other men in my life as a fatherly figure, even some of my friend's dads. Lately, I've also been questioning my orientation, and I wonder if this significant part of my life affects that. I'll save that discussion for another time.  So there you have it: a good chunk of my life story. Hopefully this will give you inspiration or ideas; it sure has for me.",no
Ricky_P,Family Structure,Only Child,"Along with living with a single mother all my life, I didn't have any siblings either. I only had at least one best friend growing up, and only a few other friends through boy scouts or church. Even in high school, I pretty much just had one best friend who I hung out with outside of school; all my other friends or acquaintances I saw at school, and only school.   This is probably why I'm shy and get intimidated when I'm in new, social environments (new school, new church, a convention I've never been to, etc.), that or it's just the way I am by nature. Ever since starting college, though, I've been trying to not be so anxious about being in social situations I'm not familiar with, and worrying that I'll make an ass of myself, even though I'm probably not. I'll stop there before I get off-topic.",no
Ricky_P,Drugs,Tobacco,"I have a basic knowledge of cigars: shape, ring gauge, length, types, most terminology, types of wrappers, and, of course, properly smoking them. I'm not all that attuned to the tastes of different brands of cigars though, just basic knowledge (which could be good enough for descriptions).",no
C.W.Euwyn,Philosophy,Ethics,"That's not to say I have the answer to right or wrong, but I know a lot of other people's answers; Kant, Aquinas, etc... I've a decent grasp on most major schools of thought when it comes to morals and ethics. I'm somewhat more knowledgable on meta-ethics, but I doubt that would come up much in a story if it wasn't primarily about it. If you're interested, I count myself as a virtue-ethicist, with a slight leaning towards consequentialism at times. I'm a moral-realist, though I've not really made my mind up in which sense. On most days it's moral non-naturalism.",no
C.W.Euwyn,Philosophy,Stoicism,I consider myself a neo-stoic.,no
C.W.Euwyn,Philosophy,Misc.,"I've a pretty good grasp of most major areas. Most knowledgable areas: Mind, Logic, Time, Society, Literature, German-Idealism, Modern Philosophy from Descartes through to Kant, Ancient Greek philosophy. I'm not too strong with Medival, though I do know quite a bit.",no
C.W.Euwyn,Philosophy,Hegelianism,"I've been through the Phenomenology, Science of Logic, and Phil of Right, so I'd say I'm pretty well versed with it. Also an avid follower of Zizek. I could talk about dialectical logic until the cows come home (and into the night, in which, all cows are black). If you want to understand Marxism then it's pretty important to know that Marx was a young-hegelian.",no
C.W.Euwyn,Society,Politics,"Fairly left-wing, but utterly ashamed of the state of the left as it is today. I consider myself a socialist, not a huge fan of neo-libertarianism. Somewhat authoritarian (as unpopular as that is), I honestly don't think people can be trusted to govern themselves in any meaningful ways. As much as people can hate me for it, if it's for the right outcome, I would agree with social-engineering (it would be alright, for example, to end stoning as a punishment in certain middle-eastern countries through subversion and controlling the media surrounding it).",no
C.W.Euwyn,Religion,Christianity,"I consider myself a Christian (even though I'm terrible). I've been through the bible, and tend to read quite a bit of Christian writing.",no
C.W.Euwyn,Sex and Sexuality,Homosexuality; Bisexuality; Homophobia,"I can be with certain women, but I much prefer men. For a long time I've been dealing with it and I still have my moments of self-hate. My parents would not approve though, so I don't mention it around them. I'm literally moving out tommorow, so I'm looking forward to finally being more open about how I feel. I'm not a terribly romantic person, but I would like a companion in life.",no
C.W.Euwyn,Society,Racism,"I'm white, but I've grown up around a very racist family. Where I've grown up we've a high asian population, esspecially people from places like India and the Middle East. I'm faily ashamed that my whole family is as racist as they are, to the point that if anybody non-white even comes on television it starts up a rant. If it wasn't for the internet and how easy it is to spread ideas, I dread to think that I'd think the same as them. Therefore, I feel I know enough to be able to write about characters who have prejudices without it being their defining characteristic. I hate racism, but at the same time, I like to think that it comes from people not knowing any better. I don't like people who hold themselves above others.",no
C.W.Euwyn,Nationalities,United Kingdom,"Born and raised in England, ergo, I know quite a bit about it. If you want to set a story in the UK then I'm fairly good to talk to. Not London though. Every time I visit I'm always afraid of everything.",no
C.W.Euwyn,Philosophy,Determinism,"Goes slightly with stoicism I suppose (which means this is in an odd order). What will happen has already happened, there is no free-will and nobody is able to choose. It's okay to punish people even though they've been determined to act, since deterency is important, but the emphasis should be on reformation.",no
C.W.Euwyn,Family Structure,Problems,I hate my parents and they don't like me either. That's really all there is to say on it. We don't see eye-to-eye and we don't like talking. I'm finally moving out and I think everyone's happy for it.,no
Wolphicorn,Biology,Wildlife Biology,"I know a decent amount about vertebrate ecology, wildlife policy, animal behavior, how one designs and conducts field studies, stuff like that. I actually just graduated with my B.S. degree in Wildlife Biology, so... yay! I've worked on several different research projects studying animals in the wild, and I've also cared for captive wildlife. I've spent a cumulative six months working at different wolf sanctuaries. I've also worked in a zoo and a wildlife rehabilitation facility. Overall, I am a biologist/zoologist by profession, so you can come to me with all your animal questions!",no
Wolphicorn,Mental Health,Autism Spectrum Disorder; Other Than Self,"My older sister has (""low-functioning"") autism, so I've grown up with a greater understanding of the disorder than most people. I've witnessed the hardships it brought to my family as well as the courage and selflessness my parents have shown in caring for my sister. I've also seen how brave my sister is, smiling and thriving in a world that's so much harder for her to live in and understand. She shows a great joy in life that is truly an inspiration to me and to everyone who meets her.",no
Wolphicorn,Religion,Christianity,"My dad was a Catholic priest who retired to marry my mom. My mom went to graduate school to study theology and creation spirituality. I grew up in a very liberal household - raised as a Christian, but I also learned about other religions and traditions and the different ways that people of different cultures have sought to find God(dess) and to make sense of our place in the order of the universe. I have seen how striving towards something greater than ourselves can change people for the better. My faith in God and in the power of unconditional love is an undeniable part of who I am.",no
